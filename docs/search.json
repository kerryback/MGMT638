Howard Creekmore Professor of Finance and Professor of Economics kerryback@gmail.com\n\n\n\nRoom 317, 2:15 – 3:45, 10/23/2023 – 12/4/2023\n\n\n\nThis course provides an introduction to quantitative equity management. Quantitative management means trading on signals that can be constructed and tested on large panels of stocks. We will use ChatGPT and python throughout the course. Students are not expected to be python experts. A side benefit of the course is the opportunity to learn and practice python. The course schedule by week is as follows:\n\nTime series models for return forecasting\nFactors and factor models\nPortfolios formed from sorts\nMachine learning models\nBacktesting portfolio strategies\nRisk analysis of portfolio strategies\n\n\n\n\nGrades will be based on weekly assignments.\n\n\n\nA follow-on to this course, Data Driven Investments Lab, will be offered as a full-semester spring course. The Lab course will involve working in groups to explore other data sources and to further elaborate and test strategies. Strategies will be implemented with paper trading at Alpaca, which is a brokerage with a free python API. I will co-teach the course with Kevin Crotty.\n\n\n\nEach year, the Chicago Quantitative Alliance (CQA) hosts a competition for universities on quantitative investing - the CQA Challenge. In each of the past two years (2021-2022; and 2022-2023), a team of JGSB MBA students won it, finishing first among 30 or so teams. The winning JGSB teams have used machine learning methods developed in this course. The competition is to run a diversified long-short market-neutral portfolio with a quantitative approach. Paper trading is done using the StockTrak platform. Teams are judged on compliance, returns, and a video presentation of their strategy in three stages: teams that perform well on compliance proceed to the second stage, the top ten teams on compliance and portfolio returns proceed to the third stage, and teams in the third stage prepare video presentations.\n\n\n\nThe Rice University honor code applies to all work in this course. Each student must do his or her own assignments, but it is allowed and in fact encouraged for students to seek advice from each other. Likewise, groups must do their projects, but they can seek advice from students in other groups. Also, searching for advice on the internet is allowed.\n\n\n\nAny student with a documented disability requiring accommodations in this course is encouraged to contact me outside of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Any adjustments or accommodations regarding assignments must be made in advance. Students with disabilities should also contact Disability Support Services in the Allen Center."

Consider two portfolios: (i) the 20 stocks with the highest predicted returns and (ii) the 20 stocks with the lowest predicted returns. Calculate the equally weighted portfolio returns for the week ending Jan 20 for each of these portfolios.\nRepeat 1-3, running the regression on the Jan 13 and Jan 20 data and computing predicted returns and portfolio returns for the Jan 27 data.\nAverage the portfolio returns over the two dates Jan 20 and Jan 27. Did the stocks with the highest predicted returns beat the stocks with the lowest predicted returns?"
