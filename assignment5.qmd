Backtest at least two random forest models for your sector, one for each definition of the target.  Other models could be backtested using different max_depth or n_estimators.  Your evaluation should contain the following:

1.  Is the strategy successful in identifying good stocks and bad stocks?
2.  Does it produce alpha relative to the market?
3.  Does it have significant factor betas and does it produce alpha relative to the factor model?
4.  What features does it seem to be using and how - that is, does it produce higher forecasts when the feature is larger or when the feature is smaller?
