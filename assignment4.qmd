Split the Boston house price data into train and test sets with test_size=0.2.
Do the following for (i) Random ForestRegressor, (ii) MLPRegressor, and (iii) Lasso.

(a) Use GridSearchCV on the training data to find the best hyperparameter.
(b) Compute the $R^2$ on the test data for the best hyperparameter.

For RandomForestRegressor,  use

```.p
param_grid = {"max_depth": range(2, 22, 2)}
```

For MLPRegressor, use

```.p
param_grid = {"hidden_layer_sizes": [[100], [100, 100], [100, 100, 100]]}
```

For Lasso, use

```.p
param_grid = {"alpha": np.arange(0.1, 2.1, 0.1)}
```
