Quantitative management means trading on signals that can be constructed and tested on large panels of stocks. Many different data sources are used to generate trading signals. We will use ChatGPT and python throughout the course. Students are not expected to be python experts. A side benefit of the course is the opportunity to learn and practice python. The course schedule by week is as follows:\n\nTime series models for return forecasting\nFactors and factor models\nPortfolios formed from sorts\nMachine learning models\nBacktesting portfolio strategies\nRisk analysis of portfolio strategies\n\n\n\n\nGrades will be based on weekly assignments (60%) and a take-home final exam (40%).\n\n\n\nA follow-on to this course, Data Driven Investments Lab, will be offered as a full-semester spring course. The Lab course will involve students working in groups to explore other data sources and to further elaborate and test strategies. Equity strategies will be implemented with paper trading at Alpaca, which is a brokerage with a free python API.\n\n\n\nEach year, the Chicago Quantitative Alliance (CQA) hosts a competition for universities on quantitative investing - the CQA Challenge. In each of the past two years (2021-2022; and 2022-2023), a team of JGSB MBA students won it, finishing first among 40 or so teams. The competition is to run a diversified long-short market-neutral portfolio with a quantitative approach. Paper trading is done using the StockTrak platform. Teams are judged on compliance, returns, and a video presentation of their strategy in three stages: teams that perform well on compliance proceed to the second stage, the top ten teams on compliance and portfolio returns proceed to the third stage, and teams in the third stage prepare video presentations.\nIf a group participates in the CQA competition, then they can work as a group in the Data-Driven Investments Lab course, and the project in that course can be configured to support participation in the competition. A team in the CQA competition is limited to five persons, but Rice can enter up to three teams. The competition begins in the first part of November. The start date is a little early relative to the timing of our courses, but you could use a generic strategy initially and then later trade into a strategy that you have optimized and tested. The contest lasts until the first of April, and participation entails a commitment until then.\n\n\n\nThe Rice University honor code applies to all work in this course. Each student must do his or her own assignments, but it is allowed and in fact encouraged for students to seek advice from each other. Likewise, groups must do their projects, but they can seek advice from students in other groups. Also, searching for advice on the internet is allowed.\n\n\n\nAny student with a documented disability requiring accommodations in this course is encouraged to contact me outside of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Any adjustments or accommodations regarding assignments or the final exam must be made in advance. Students with disabilities should also contact Disability Support Services in the Allen Center."
