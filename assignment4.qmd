Split the Boston house price data into train and test sets with test_size=0.
Do the following for Random ForestRegressor and MLPRegressor.

(a) Use GridSearchCV on the training data to find the best hyperparameter.
(b) Compute the $R^2$ on the test data for the best hyperparameter.

For RandomForestRegressor,  use

```.p
param_grid = {"max_depth": range(2, 22, 2)}
```

For MLPRegressor, use

```.p
param_grid = {"hidden_layer_sizes": [[100, [100, 100], [100, 100, 100]]]}
```
